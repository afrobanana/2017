  Bombasoul was born and raised in the UK on a strict diet of barbecued meat and grilled halloumi, but was, and still is, deeply inspired and influenced by the deep lineage and heritage of dance music emanating from New York’s Larry Levan, to UK Jungle, carnival sound systems, squat parties, late night radio, Soho record shops and beyond! Now living in Cyprus, Bombasoul happily shares his passion of wide spectrum soulful dance music.
