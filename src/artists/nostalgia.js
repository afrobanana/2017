‘Nostalgia’ is a series of Cyprus dance parties taking audiences on whirlwind journeys through the music and emotions of past dance culture. Their selections cover some of the most celebrated and treasured songs from the 1940s-90s and are aimed at those who ‘experienced’ and danced through those decades, but also, those curious to find out what it was like! At the ABR Festival, two Nostalgia DJs will be delivering a lively 3-hour set filled with fun, positive energy and carefully-selected tunes.
