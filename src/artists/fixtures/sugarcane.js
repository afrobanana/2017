NU JAZZ; FUNK

A newly formed trio featuring some of Cyprus’ finest musicians – Marios Takousshis, Stelios Xydias and Cahit Kurtrafali - they’ll be delighting the crowds with a raw mix of original jazz funk, neo soul and electronic hip hop. Accentuated by touch of robotic vocals, deep bass lines and fiery grooves, these talents translate virtuosity into something that hits you right in the heart.
