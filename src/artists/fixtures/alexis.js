The driving force behind the infamous Phase event series in Berlin’s club Griessmuehle, and curator of ABR's Out of The Box since its inception, Alexis combines various electronic subgenres to create his own vision of future music, centred around the timelessness of innovative house and techno music, inspired by the past, focused on the future. A sound that is built upon his Cypriot/Chilean roots and his experience as a creative force for 16 years in Berlin’s vibrant electronic music and art scene, this DJ focuses on forward thinking, futuristic, rough textured sound. Be it acid, Detroit techno, EBM connotations, wave, electro, house and progressive beats, these influences are the key ingredients, that lead to a recipe unlike the rest, an explosive cocktail creating a truly unique atmosphere on the dance floor.
