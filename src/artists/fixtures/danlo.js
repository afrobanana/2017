A resident of The Observatory in HCMC/Saigon - regarded by many in the region and beyond as one of Asia’s foremost underground nightclubs - Dan Lo is known for playing an eclectic blend of rare house, strange disco and dub techno with a distinct afro-electric twist, including powerful edits of Afrobeat and other obscurities.

His approach to dance floor ignition generally follows a trajectory of deep, rare and raw sound power, designed for full immersion and movement. Hailing from Cyprus by way of London, Dan Lo has played alongside numerous key figures in the scene, featured in countless bars, clubs and festivals, from Saigon and Hong Kong to London, Tokyo and Berlin. In Vietnam, he heated things up at the last two instalments of the Quest Festival and also played in the first edition of Equation 2017.
