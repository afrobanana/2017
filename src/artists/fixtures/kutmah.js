Although born in England, Justin 'Kutmah' McNulty moved to the U.S. at a young age and grew up in California, where he ultimately made a name for himself as an exceptionally talented underground artist & DJ. An intrinsic member of the eclectic Los Angeles-based music collective "dublab", in 2004 Kutmah launched the seminal Sketchbook club, which forged the fundamental roots of the now-infamous LA beat scene. Kutmah has played at shows with Saul Williams, The Gaslamp Killer, Flying Lotus, Gonjasufi, Dabrye and others.
