What do pasta and the universe have in common?  A great deal apparently! Astral Pasta is a new radio talk show duo (Constantinos and Maria) who keep busy and highly entertained serving dedicated audiences unusual online broadcasts. Mainly chatting away about astrological phenomena, the conversation is interjected with all sorts of music related to the subject matter at hand. And so, the duo advise all festival goers who may be falling out regular dietary patterns this summer, to stick around for their special remedy: astrological advice and nonsense sprinkled with some fab music thatâ€™s out of season.
