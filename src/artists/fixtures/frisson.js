SOUL; GROOVE; HIP HOP; REGGAE; JAZZ

Playing their own brand of groove since 2013, Trio Frisson is a 3-member Cypriot band (Jamie Paul, Byron Athinodorou and Lefteris Lekatis) referring to their sound as Hip-Soul - a blend of ingredients taken from Soul, RnB & Hip Hop, fused with a range of influences including Reggae, Funk, Jazz and even Latin. The Trio often take to the stage with guest musicians, expanding on the bandâ€™s rhythm-based approach and garnishing their sound with jazzy melody lines and solos.

For ABR 2017 the band's performance will feature special guest musicians on brass, adding a foot-tapping 70's funk flavour to the performance and driving the show to new heights. The band is currently producing their second studio album with all original songs.
