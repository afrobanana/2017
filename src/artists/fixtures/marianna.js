She may be a great DJ but Marianna claims to be more of an ‘eclectic music selector’, fascinated by music from a very young age while having developed a deep connection to rock culture. And although she started DJing ‘by accident’, her rock oriented sets are characterised by eclecticism and a high aesthetic. Expect to hear some seriously cool Psych and Electro Rock at the ABR Festival!
