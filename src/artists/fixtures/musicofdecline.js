DJ, musician and producer, many know Mr. Fox (Andreas Stylianou) as a regular party starter at some of the coolest venues and festivals on the island. Appearing at the ABR Festival under the alias of ‘Musicofdecline’ - his solo hip hop project -  a growing passion for music has found him tirelessly writing and producing his own music for the past three years, now presenting his debut solo album at the ABR Festival. A full on Hip-Hop album which aggressively but playfully critiques current socioeconomic systems and the powers they hold over modern societies and their populations, it takes a satiric but endearing look at the much loved culture of Hip-Hop, while exposing some of the artist's most personal inner workings. Andreas will be joined at this performance by visual artist Maria Andreou.
