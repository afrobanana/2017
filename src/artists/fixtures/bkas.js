DJ Bkas (Charalambos Kleanthous) has been passionately DJing around Cyprus for the past decade, remembered by many for his initial sets at Scarabeo Bar, with Reggae and Hip Hop/RnB beats seriously heating up the dance floor. Introduced to Turntablism and vinyl in 2015, he begun to create his own DJ routines, including scratching and beat jugging. Today, he is the resident DJ of "Urban Vibe", "Jamrock Reggae Party", "Strawberry Jam" and "The Throwback Concept" and he is now preparing a set filled with hip hop, energy and creativity for the upcoming festival.
