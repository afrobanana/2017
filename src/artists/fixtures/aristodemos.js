A well established name on the Cyprus electronic music scene, Aristodemos has been keeping busy over the past few years, leaving his mark at the islandâ€™s top festivals, bars and clubs. His musical range is far reaching yet focused; a mixture of dub aesthetics and electronic precision, forever injecting a touch of soul into his sets. We are thrilled to host him at ABR's Out of The Box stage for the first time this year!
