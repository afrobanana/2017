HIP HOP, BASS, TRIBAL

Intent on triggering both ears and minds, Angeliki views each musical selection as a journey and special expression without conforming to any specific genre. Not just about aesthetically pleasing tracks, she loves loves rarities and eclectic sounds with a deep affection for primitive elements, heavy basslines and beats. Having appeared as a selector at one of the coolest venues on the island, Sousami Bar, Angeliki has been fine tuning her DJ skills ever since.
