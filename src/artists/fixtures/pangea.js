Firm in the belief that the most effective way of fighting against cultural conflict and contemptuous attitudes towards our differences lies in music, Radio Pangea love the fact that music brings people together and builds bridges between cultures.

And now, they now invite crowds to join a multicultural entertainment experience that includes Middle Eastern Rhythms, Gypsy Punk, Balkan Beats, Electro-Swing, Latin-Ska, Anatolian Grooves, Electro-Tango and Nu jazz, as well as Latin Grooves and Rumb-Dub Style, Rai, African-Reggae and Latin Hiphop. That’s not to forget Rock ’n’ Roll Drum ’n’ Bass, Funk, Punk music and tunes from the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's, 90’s and 2000's.
