Having performed at the last three ABR Festivals, music loving crowds just can’t get enough of Kineza’s groovin’ beats, etheric bleeps and tribal rhythms. Always exploring the relationship between different genres and likening playing and sharing music to “curating a form of mind migration”, she has been known to get crowds dancing just about everywhere! Having played alongside technobeat giants Randomer and LOAN, her escapades take her to parties across Cyprus, the UK and Beirut. We are really looking forward to have her again this year at ABR's Out of The Box stage!
