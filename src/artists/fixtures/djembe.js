All about groovy tunes, Djembe radio was born and cradled at the University of Leeds, encompassing an immense love for Afrobeat music. From the get go, it has brought listeners strongly rooted music with exciting explorations and fusions of Mauritian, Cuban, Venezuelan and Indonesian cultural sounds. Prepare to tap those toes and shake those hips; this is one musical session you wonâ€™t easily forget.
