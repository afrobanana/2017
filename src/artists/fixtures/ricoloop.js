The Berlin based multi-instrumentalist has excited audiences worldwide with his signature live performances across the musical spectrum and is now excited to make some serious noise at the ABR festival.  Rico Loop is a genre defying artist that utilizes live looping (live recording) of himself to build a multi layered sonic template that brings new meaning to the term “one man band.”

BOSS/Roland and Native Instruments have proudly endorsed Rico Loop and showcased his talents at both the NAMM Show (Anaheim,California) and Musikmesse (Frankfurt,Germany). The musician has also been invited to perform with Bobby McFerrin and Chick Corea in Berlin and has performed at countless festivals including Denmark’s Roskilde Festival, Norway’s Kongsburg Jazz Festival and Germany’s Fusion Festival.
