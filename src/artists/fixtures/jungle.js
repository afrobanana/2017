This world renowned Amsterdam band has turned countless dance floors into boiler rooms: from Istanbul to Tokyo and from Paris to the isle of Vlieland, nobody can withstand their afro beats, ethiobreaks, Turkish psych and spicy cumbia. Their latest album, The Traveller, takes the journey deep into the jungle and an unknown world with keys and horns taking the lead.

Set to make crowds dance the night away in the most carefree fashion, all sorts of varying influences come together, largely inspired by their global travels. Where have they performed? Just about everywhere...from Glastonbury and the immense Fuji Rock in Japan, to the Montreal Jazz Festival and beyond. Right now, they just couldn’t resist stopping off in Cyprus for the ABR Festival
