Having performed at popular festivals and Cyprus night time hot-spots like Palia Pineza, Sousami and New Division, there are no boarders here: just a mix of international oriented sounds, and a dancing ceremony of beats and percussions from all far flung corners of the globe!

This is one DJ that takes world beats mighty seriously, so seriously in fact, that he just canâ€™t stop looking for constant inspiration, whether he is searching in the most random hidden spots or digging for it in the street. Offering audiences a journey around the world, festival goers can expect a mix of genres, from  Afro, Arab Funk and Electro-Balkan, to Rumba, Electrify Flamenco &amp, Cumbia, Ska &amp, Mambo and much more!
