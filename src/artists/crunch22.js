Mixing cool funk, electronica, blues, dub and afrobeat, this Israeli trio turns every concert into one huge surprise party. The three hyperactive musicians play live psychedelic grooves out of a strange combination of rhodes-piano (Tomer Baruch), drums (Dan Mayo), and turntables (Erez Todres).
How did it all begin? They started off playing at major festivals in Israel and soon went on to wow the crowds at the likes of the Waves Festival in Vienna and Bratislava. Their critically acclaimed debut album and 7-inch vinyl record were released in the summer of 2013, and the band’s second album, Crunch 22 mess with Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, is a musical version of the paragon of psychedelic literature.
