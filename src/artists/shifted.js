TECHNO

Following the dissolution of his esteemed Commix group, Shifted (Guy Brewer) uprooted his UK drum n bass beginnings and set up base in Berlin. From his debut on Luke Slater's ‘Mote Evolver’ label, to Dominick Fernow's ‘Bed Of Nails’ and his recent recordings for his own smartly curated imprint, ‘Avian’, Brewer's work colours outside purist lines, pushing boundaries and provoking thought in a call to progressive techno, electronic, noise and experimental music.

Brewer has also birthed numerous other projects; notably the techno-drone outfit, ‘Covered In Sand’, and the soundtrack wielding of Alexander Lewis. With a steadfast dedication to a perpetual movement forward, Brewer embodies the pure, unadulterated spirit of what it means to be an electronic musician: a rebel artist treading into new territories with a fascination and fixation to craft brilliance with a new noise.
