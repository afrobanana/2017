JAZZ; MULTI-GENRE

Bringing together a select pick of some of the island’s most talented jazz musicians (Alkis Agathokleous, Andreas Rodosthenous, Andreas Stefanou, Elias Ioannou and Ermis Michael) audiences can expect distinctive melodies with strong transitions in dynamics, flexible grooves and plenty of improvisation.

The Ney, an instrument with roots in Central Asia several thousand years ago, is used as the 'voice' of the electric ensemble. And the result? A fusion of various genres of music with strong jazz influences, as well as ethnic and stoner stimulus, with each experimental composition forming a distinct album of images, progressing according to each musician’s intervention on stage. A colourful journey of sound that combines East and West with unprecedented mastery!
