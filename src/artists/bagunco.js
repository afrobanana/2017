When the lively Bagunco take to the stage, prick your ears for an intoxicating blend of Brazilian music drawing on jazz, fusion and funk. Born from a chance meeting of street carnival musicians in Rio de Janeiro, Bagun√ßo boasts an upbeat sound that fuses rich Brazilian rhythms with jazz-rock and funk energy. Since 2013, the six Brazilians and two French band members have developed their stage personas and their improvisational skills in the streets and concert halls of Brazil, but much more than a jazz group or a mobile brass band, the multi-instrumentalists take audiences with them on a whirlwind journey through the unique Rio indie scene.
