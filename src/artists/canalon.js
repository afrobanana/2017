Prepare for the sweetly **exuberant** chanting of three tantalising female voices, led by Nidia Góngora, accentuated by the sounds of the marimba, drums & guasa percussion whisking audiences far far away to Colombia's Pacific coast and the town of Timbiquí, embodying the rich musical mix of African and Latin-American traditions unique to the area. Collaborating with Quantic for the past five years and touring across Europe, the group’s latest album, Arrullando,  gathers the most traditional rhythms from the Pacific Coast and has been nominated for ‘Best Folclor Record’ at Colombia’s Shock Awards; the most important music awards in the country.
