Imagine a seven-headed rhythmic beast with a percussionist, drummer, bassist, keyboardist, two horn players, and a DJ up on the stage embracing the musical totality of the world without any folklore kitsch, breaking down barriers between musical genres. Welcome to the wonderful world of Feindrehstar!

The studio recordings of this unique German band have long been known to capture the live energy of their onstage performances across the world, from festivals like The Elbjazz Festival and the Kulturarena Jena, to the WÃ¼rzburger Hafensommer and many other international appearances across Europe and as far as Zimbabwe, Madagascar, Namibia and Angola. And now, Feindrehstar presents their second album, Love & Hoppiness, five years after their brilliant debut: Vulgarian Knights.
