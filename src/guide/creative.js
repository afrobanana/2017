        <h3>ENTER ODDLAND! (Non conformist territory)</h3>
        <p>Forget normality, reject reality! Enter ODDLAND: a dystopian amusement park that will blow your mind. A space for creative expression within the ABR Festival grounds where all artistic projects will be coming to life, it’s set to be a real creative whirlwind! What to expect apart from the unexpected? Here are some tantalising teasers below. </p>

            <dt>Taroom</dt>
            <dd>Nothing is set in stone. Or is it? Prepare for a room shrouded in mystery as Graphic Designer and Illustrator, Anna Miltiadou (BrainFKR) whisks you away on a wild journey. She may tell you who you are, or maybe you’ll tell her who you are or want to be...but none of it would be possible without finding the Joker located somewhere in the forest land...</dd>

            <dt>Zoetrope</dt>
            <dd>Ever experienced the visual splendour of a Zoetrope? A pre-film animation device that produces the illusion of motion with a sequence of drawings or photos, artist Nurtane Karagil has been busy creating what she calls a type of ‘personal cinema’. Odd, mystical and a fun way to look at serious topics, she’ll be sparking your curiosity as you take a peak at what’s inside this weird and wonderful ‘circus’ show! </dd>

            <dt>Tesura</dt>
            <dd>It’s often said that ‘one man’s trash is another man’s treasure’? Alexandros Ioannou Peletie certainly takes this idiom to heart, using an artistic approach to upcycling, exploring ways of creating value out of waste, with respect to the environment. With ‘Tesura’ being a portmanteau of the Spanish words for treasure and trash, this artistic project sees garbage as an opportunity, and explores the possibilities that can occur when putting ‘waste’ to good use. Based on the philosophy of circular economy, it promotes environmental awareness and action through reduce, reuse and recycle.  </dd>

            <dt>Brainbombing V.2</dt>
            <dd>Are you ready to challenge your perception of the space around you? First conceived at the ABR Festival 2015, street artist Twenty Three is back to take you into a parallel universe with a mixed media installation that you’ll have to enter to experience. Acting as an isolated space within the festival grounds, a ‘black hole’ filled with surrealistic layers, an interactive experience awaits once you enter the box....as you immerse yourselves in a dark ambience, accentuated by strobe lighting, repetitive images and figures.</dd>

            <dt>The Bounce mad</dt>
            <dd>“Perhaps she would get me, after all!/If the links should break, I might feel small,/Young as I was, and strong and tall,/And blest with a human shape,/To see myself foil’d in that lonely place/By a desperate brute with a monstrous face,/And hugg’d to death in the foul embrace/Of a loathly angry ape,” Arthur Munby's "Pastrana". A performance which draws unusual connections between gender norms and bodies, while defying the limits of the everyday, expect imagery of extreme physicality and odd-bodied characters, justifying the positive dimensions of freakiness. </dd>

            <dt>Le Voyage dans la Lune</dt>
            <dd>8x8 are commencing the countdown for an interactive performance about to bring music to your ears and the sweetest dreams to all participants and 'travellers'! Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the magnificent Le Voyage dans la Lune; an odd place where decay meets space and time, and where curious characters brush stardust off their shoulders and raise their glasses to the masters of the genre. Take your protein pills, put your helmet on, and be sure not to let the space bugs bite!              </dd>
