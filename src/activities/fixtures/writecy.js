Community storytelling is experiencing a revival worldwide. And it isn’t hard to see why! Sharing stories before live audiences is an antidote to our increasingly virtual existences, making our communities more connected and lively places. Write Cy is now staging an Open Mic Night at the ABR Festival, inviting all creative types to perform, as long as you have original material and can perform it in under five minutes.

The Nicosia-based creative writing space recently introduced live storytelling in Cyprus, drawing a local community of local storytellers, poets and provocateurs who gather at Prozak Kafeneio once a month to tell their stories.
