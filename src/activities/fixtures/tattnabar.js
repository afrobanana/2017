What do you classify as a ‘musical instrument’? Are you willing to think outside the box? Musician Lefteris Moschovias (founder of the well-known Tat-Tnabar) will be showing music-loving crowds at the ABR Festival how to unleash their creative spirit and make instruments out of a whole range of unusual items and recycled goods.

 Proving that pretty much anything and everything can be used to make fantastic sounds, the workshop aims to change the way we perceive the creation of music, how we react to given sounds, and how everyday objects can be transformed into the most  magical sound music making machines, inspired by Europe, Africa, Asia and beyond.

**Capacity:** No limits

**Duration:** 2.5 hours
