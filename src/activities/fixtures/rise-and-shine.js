# ${ name }

Get up bright and early in the forest land to use breath and movement on a journey that will awaken your body and mind! With a yoga session, suitable for adults of all levels led by Nina Hadjidemetriou, prepare to start off with a cleansing pranayama practice, then moving through a smooth warm-up, before you energize and ground yourselves with a standing sequence and then unwinding with some balancing and seated asanas. It will all draw to a close with a relaxation and a short meditation inviting gratitude and joy for the day. ‘Rise and Shine’ yoga will be taking place on both the Friday and Saturday of the festival.

**Capacity:** 12 people (bring your own mat)

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Age Group:** All ages
