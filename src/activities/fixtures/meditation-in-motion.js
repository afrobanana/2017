Enjoy the feeling of overwhelming calm on the ABR festival grounds as you’re given the chance to partake in exquisite flow meditation in two Tai Chi workshops (both Friday and Saturday)! A graceful and dynamic rendition of Cheng Man Ching’s famous 37 short form, one of the oldest and most respected forms in China, teacher Alexis will be on hand to show you various moves, as the mind relaxes and becomes more meditative, nourishing the concentration of internal power. All moves are meant to imitate nature, so there’s really no better place to experience Tai Chi than the great outdoors in beautiful Kornos Forest.

**Capacity:** No limits

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Age Group:** All ages
